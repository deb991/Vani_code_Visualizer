**<h2>Jarine Code Visualizer</h2>**

Initiate code visualizer, below are the procedure.

    `git clone <repository url>`

In the initial commit, I only add single procedure for visualization. 
To be more specific, in the upcoming releases, I will try to integrate 
more complex procedure to make easy & users friendly results.  

    `pip install -r req.txt'
To make Project ready environment. 

Once set up got completed. we can proceed to test our first script 
& visualize the output. 

    `python .\\code_tracer\\caller\\__init__.py`

Hence, once, to execute the called script, we need to provide actual 
script location along with Directory.

                                    `python .\caller\__init__.py`
 
Now followed by `Script Path` will be input file prompt. 
Where we need to provide full file path. 

File will be generated as per {input script fullpath, but '_' separated} 
to make it easier to find. 

More changes to come.
